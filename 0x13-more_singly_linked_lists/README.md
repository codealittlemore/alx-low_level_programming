1. Project Name: 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

2. Project Description:
The "C - More Singly Linked Lists" project is an advanced exploration of singly linked lists in the C programming language. A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure, and this project takes it to the next level by implementing additional functionality and optimizations.

3. Installation:
Project does not require installation. you can find more information here https://intranet.alxswe.com/projects/230

4. Usage:
Basic test on the alx intranet website.

5. Configuration:
- Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the project's repository to your local machine.

- Read the Documentation: Review the project's documentation to understand the code structure and its objectives.

- Explore the Code: Dive into the C code, which is organized into modular functions, making it easier to comprehend and modify.

- Contribute: Feel free to contribute by fixing bugs, optimizing code, or adding new features. Follow the project's contribution guidelines.

- Contributing:
Project done by Adebayo Kokumo using the Alx guidelines for test knowledge

6. License:
Complete license owned by Alx Africa.

7. Usage Examples:
-A typical example is Creating a Linked List:

Copy code
// Create an empty linked list
struct Node* head = NULL;

// Add elements to the list
append(&head, 1);
append(&head, 2);
append(&head, 3);

Acknowledgments:
My express gratitude to the ALX team for the opportunity to learn and build c knowledge.
